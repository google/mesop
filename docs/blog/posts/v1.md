# Mesop v1

After developing Mesop for nearly a year and a half and publicly launching it on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40567327) 9 months ago, we are excited to release Mesop v1.

It's been an amazing journey working on Mesop, especially with [richard-to@](http://github.com/richard-to) who's been my 20% collaborator at Google. Despite being an extremely small core team (working on this as a 20% project!), we've been able to foster a thriving community both within Google where hundreds of Googlers have used it to build internal apps and outside of Google where it's been downloaded [more than 180k times](https://pepy.tech/projects/mesop) on PyPI.

## What v1 means

Mesop v1 signifies our commitment to prioritizing stability and avoiding backwards-incompatible changes unless absolutely necessary—such as important security fixes or critical bug fixes.

Since we publicly launched 9 months ago, we have taken a conservative approach to making API changes, avoiding backwards-incompatible changes as much as possible. This has been key to Mesop's successful adoption both within Google and externally. In addition, Google's [reputation for churn](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch15.html#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20an%20old,and%20fast%2Dpaced.) has made us careful in designing our APIs.

Almost all Mesop apps should be able to seamlessly upgrade to v1. The only backwards-incompatible change we made from v0.14 is to drop `mel.text_io` which has been deprecated for many months and can be replaced with [`mel.text_to_text`](https://google.github.io/mesop/components/text-to-text/) as a simple one-line change.

## Future of Mesop

You might have also noticed that Mesop has graduated from the Google GitHub org into its own GitHub org. Becoming a community-driven project is beneficial for the longevity of Mesop. Rest assured, Mesop continues to have the same core maintainers and the roadmap remains the same.

v1 doesn't mean the end of Mesop's development. We plan to add new components over time, maintain our dependencies, provide more examples, and generally improve the overall developer experience.

While we can’t make firm commitments, our goal is to remain on v1 for as long as possible, avoiding a jump to v2.
