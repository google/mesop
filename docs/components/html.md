## Overview

The HTML component allows you to add custom HTML to your Mesop app.

> Note: the HTML is [sanitized by Angular](https://angular.dev/best-practices/security#sanitization-example) for web security reasons so potentially unsafe code like JavaScript is removed.

## Examples

<iframe class="component-demo" src="https://mesop-y677hytkra-uc.a.run.app/html"></iframe>

```python
--8<-- "demo/html_demo.py"
```
