# Config

## Overview

Mesop is configured at the application level using environment variables.

## Configuration values

### MESOP_STATE_SESSION_BACKEND

Sets the backend to use for caching state data server-side. This makes it so state does
not have to be sent to the server on every request, reducing bandwidth, especially if
you have large state objects.

The backend options available at the moment are `memory` and `file`.

#### memory

Users should be careful when using the `memory` backend. Each Mesop process has their
own RAM, which means cache misses will be common if each server has multiple processes
and there is no session affinity. In addition, the amount of RAM must be carefully
specified per instance in accordance with the expected user traffic and state size.

The safest option for using the `memory` backend is to use a single process with a
good amount of RAM. Python is not the most memory efficient, especially when saving data
structures such as dicts.

The drawback of being limited to a single process is that requests will take longer to
process since only one request can be handled at a time. This is especially problematic
if your application contains long running API calls.

If session affinity is available, you can scale up multiple instances, each running
single processes.

#### file

Users should be careful when using the `file` backend. Each Mesop instance has their
own disk, which can be shared among multiple processes. This means cache misses will be
common if there are multiple instances and no session affinity.

If session affinity is available, you can scale up multiple instances, each running
multiple Mesop processes. If no session affinity is available, then you can only
vertically scale a single instance.

The bottleneck with this backend is the disk read/write performance. The amount of disk
space must also be carefully specified per instance in accordance with the expected user
traffic and state size.

You will also need to specify a directory to write the state data using
`MESOP_STATE_SESSION_BACKEND_FILE_BASE_DIR`.

**Default:** `none`

### MESOP_STATE_SESSION_BACKEND_FILE_BASE_DIR

This is only used when the `MESOP_STATE_SESSION_BACKEND` is set to `file`. This
parameter specifies where Mesop will read/write the session state. This means the
directory must be readable and writeable by the Mesop server processes.

**Default:** `/tmp`

## Usage Examples

### One-liner

You can specify the environment variables before the mesop command.

```sh
MESOP_STATE_SESSION_BACKEND=memory mesop main.py
```

### Use a .env file

Mesop also supports `.env` files. This is nice since you don't have to keep setting
the environment variables. In addition, the variables are only set when the application
is run.

```sh title=".env"
MESOP_STATE_SESSION_BACKEND=memory
```

When you run your Mesop app, the .env file will then be read.

```sh
mesop main.py
```
