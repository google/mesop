## Contributing to docs

If you want to contribute to our docs, please take a look at our [docs issues](https://github.com/google/mesop/labels/docs). If you find any of our existing docs confusing or missing key information, please file an issue and we will see how we can improve things. We regularly spend time improving our docs because we know it's a key part of the developer experience.

## Contributing examples

One of the best way of helping the Mesop project is to share what you've built! You can either add an example to our demo gallery by adding it to the [demo/](https://github.com/google/mesop/tree/main/demo) directory or you can send us a link to your app running and we will include it in our docs.

## Contributing code

If you'd like to contribute code, I recommend taking a look at one of our existing ["starter" issues](https://github.com/google/mesop/labels/starter). These are issues that are good for first-time contributors as they are well-specified.

- [Setup your dev environment](./development.md)
- If you're creating a new component, you can follow the [new component guide](./new_component.md)

I recommend reading through the various pages in the contributing section as it will give you a sense of our project's goals.

One thing that we focus on is providing an easy-to-understand API with minimal breaking changes so we ask that any API changes are first discussed in an issue. This will help prevent wasted work because we are conservative with changing our APIs.
