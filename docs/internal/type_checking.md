# Type Checking

## Python Type Checking

For our Python code, we use [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) as our static type checker because it has excellent IDE support in VS Code via [pylance](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release).

To run Python type-checking, run:

```shell
./scripts/run_py_typecheck.sh
```

This will setup the pre-requisites needed for type-checking.
