# Publishing

Follow these instructions for releasing a new version of Mesop publicly via PyPI (e.g. `pip install mesop`).

If you haven't done this before, follow the [first-time setup](#first-time-upload-setup).

## Update version to RC

Update [`mesop/version.py`](https://github.com/google/mesop/blob/main/mesop/version.py) by incrementing the version number. We follow semver.

You want to first create an RC (release candidate) to ensure that it works.

For example, if the current version is: `0.7.0`, then you should increment the version to `0.8.0rc0` which will create an RC, which is treated as a [pre-release by PyPI](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#pre-releases).

## Install locally

From the workspace root, run the following command:

```sh
$ source ./scripts/pip.sh
```

This will build the Mesop pip package and install it locally so you can test it.

## Testing locally

### Dev CLI

The above shell script will run the following command:

```sh
$ mesop main.py
```

This will start the Mesop dev server and you can test that hot reload works.

### Gunicorn integration

```sh
$ pip install gunicorn && gunicorn main:me
```

## Upload to PyPI

If the testing above looks good, then continue with uploading to PyPI.

```sh
rm -rf /tmp/mesoprelease-test/venv-twine \
&& virtualenv --python python3 /tmp/mesoprelease-test/venv-twine \
&& source /tmp/mesoprelease-test/venv-twine/bin/activate \
&& pip install --upgrade pip \
&& pip install twine \
&& cd /tmp/mesoprelease-test \
&& twine upload mesop*.whl
```

Visit [https://pypi.org/project/mesop/](https://pypi.org/project/mesop/) to see that the new version has been published.

## Test on Colab

Because Colab installs from PyPI, you will need to test the RC on Colab after uploading to PyPI.

Open our [Mesop Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/mesop/blob/main/notebooks/mesop_colab_getting_started.ipynb) and run all the cells and make sure it works. Usually if something breaks in Colab, it's pretty obvious because the output isn't displayed, etc.

## Change the version from RC to regular release

If you find an issue, then redo the above steps and create another RC candidate: `0.8.0rc0` -> `0.8.0rc1`.

If all the testing looks good, then you can update [`mesop/version.py`](https://github.com/google/mesop/blob/main/mesop/version.py) and change the version from RC to a regular release, for example:

`0.8.0rc0` -> `0.8.0`

Re-do the steps above to build, test and upload it to PyPI.

## First-time upload setup

Create a file `~/.pypirc`:

```yaml
[pypi]
  username = __token__
  password = {{password}}
```

You will need to get a PyPI token generated by one of the project maintainers.
