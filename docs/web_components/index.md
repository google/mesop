# Web Components

> Note: Web components are a new experimental feature released under labs and may have breaking changes.

Mesop allows you to define custom components with web components which is a set of web standards that allows you to use JavaScript and CSS to define custom HTML elements.

## Use cases

- **Custom JavaScript** - You can execute custom JavaScript and have simple bi-directional communication between the JavaScript code running in the browser and the Python code running the server.

- **JavaScript libraries** - If you want to use a JavaScript library, you can wrap them with a web component.

- **Rich-client side interactivity** - You can use web components to deliver stateful client-side interactions without a network roundtrip.

## Anatomy of a web component

Mesop web component consists of two parts:

- **Python module** - defines a Python API so that your Mesop app can use the web component seamlessly.
- **JavaScript module** - implements the web component.

## Next steps
