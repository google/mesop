# Mesop DuoChat Codelab

This tutorial walks you through building DuoChat, an interactive web application for chatting with multiple AI models simultaneously. You'll learn how to leverage Mesop's powerful features to create a responsive UI and integrate with AI APIs like Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude.

### What you will build

By the end of this codelab, you will build [DuoChat (demo)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/wwwillchen/mesop-duo-chat) that will allow users to:

- Select multiple AI models to chat with
- Compare responses from different models side-by-side
- Provide their own API keys

If you want to dive straight into the code, you can look at the [DuoChat repo](https://github.com/wwwillchen/mesop-duo-chat) and each branch represents the completed code after each section.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

Let's start by setting up our development environment:

1. Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir duochat
cd duochat
```

2. Follow the [Mesop command-line installation guide](../getting_started/installing.md#b-command-line) and create a [virtual environment](../getting_started/installing.md#create-a-venv-environment) and activate it.

3. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```
mesop
gunicorn
anthropic
google-generativeai
```

4. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up the Main Application

Let's start by creating a basic Mesop application. Create `main.py` and add the following code:

```python
import mesop as me

@me.page(path="/")
def page():
    me.text("Welcome to DuoChat!")
```

This creates a simple Mesop application with a welcome message.

### Running the Application

To run your Mesop application:

```bash
mesop main.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:32123` in your web browser. You should see the welcome message.

### Getting API keys

Later on, you will need API keys to call the respective AI models:

- [Get a Google Gemini API Key](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) and use the Gemini API [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing).
- [Get an Anthropic API Key](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/quickstart#prerequisites). Check their docs for pricing.

> TIP: You can get started with one API key and create the other one later.

### Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble, compare your code to the [solution](https://github.com/wwwillchen/mesop-duo-chat/tree/1_completed).

### Next Steps

In the next section, we'll start building the user interface for DuoChat, including the header, chat input area, and basic styling. We'll explore Mesop's components and styling system to create an attractive and functional layout.
