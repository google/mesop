This doc will explain the core concepts of building a Mesop app.

## Hello World app

Let's start by creating a simple Hello World app in Mesop:

```python
--8<-- "mesop/examples/docs/hello_world.py"
```

This simple example demonstrates a few things:

- Every Mesop app starts with `import mesop as me`. This is the only recommended way to import mesop, otherwise your app may break in the future because you may be relying on internal implementation details.
- `@me.page` is a function decorator which makes a function a _root component_ for a particular path. If you omit the `path` parameter, this is the equivalent of `@me.page(path="/")`.
- `app` is a Python function that we will call a __component__ because it's creating Mesop components in the body.

## Components

Components are the building blocks of a Mesop application. A Mesop application is essentially a tree of components.

Let's explain the different kinds of components in Mesop:

- Mesop comes built-in with __native__ components. These are components implemented using Angular/Javascript. Many of these components wrap [Angular Material components](https://material.angular.io/components/).
- You can also create your own components which are called __user-defined__ components. These are essentially Python functions like `app` in the previous example.

## Counter app

Let's build a more complex app to demonstrate Mesop's interactivity features.

```python
--8<-- "mesop/examples/docs/counter.py"
```

This app allows the user to click on a button and increment a counter, which is shown to the user as "Clicks: #".

Let's walk through this step-by-step.

### State

The `State` class represents the application state for a particular browser session. This means every user session has its own instance of `State`.

`@me.stateclass` is a class decorator which is similar to Python's [dataclass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) but also sets default values based on type hints and allows Mesop to inject the class as shown next.

> Note: Everything in a state class must be serializable because it's sent between the server and browser.

### Event handler

The `button_click` function is an event handler. An event handler has a single parameter, `event`, which can contain a value (this will be shown in the next example). An event handler is responsible for updating state based on the incoming event.

`me.state(State)` retrieves the instance of the state class for the current session.

### Component

Like the previous example, `main` is a Mesop component function which is decorated with `page` to mark it as a root component for a path.

Similar to the event handler, we can retrieve the state in a component function by calling `me.state(State)`.

> Note: it's _not_ safe to mutate state inside a component function. All mutations must be done in an event handler.

Rendering dynamic values in Mesop is simple because you can use standard Python string interpolation use f-strings:

```python
me.text(f"Clicks: {state.clicks}")
```

The button component demonstrates connecting an event handler to a component. Whenever a click event is triggered by the component, the registered event handler function is called:

```python
me.button("Increment", on_click=button_click)
```

In summary, you've learned how to define a state class, an event handler and wire them together using interactive components.
