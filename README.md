### Used at Google for rapid internal app development

Mesop is a Python-based UI framework that allows you to rapidly build web apps like demos and internal apps:

**Intuitive for UI novices ‚ú®**

- Write UI in idiomatic Python code
- Easy to understand reactive UI paradigm
- Ready to use components

**Frictionless developer workflows üèéÔ∏è**

- Hot reload so the browser automatically reloads and preserves state
- Rich IDE support with strong type safety

**Flexible for delightful demos ü§©**

- Build custom UIs _without_ writing Javascript/CSS/HTML
- Compose your UI into components, which are just Python functions

## Write your first Mesop app in less than 10 lines of code...

[Demo app](https://mesop-dev.github.io/mesop/demo/?demo=text_to_text)

```python
import mesop as me
import mesop.labs as mel


@me.page(path="/text_to_text", title="Text to Text Example")
def app():
  mel.text_to_text(
    upper_case_stream,
    title="Text to Text Example",
  )


def upper_case_stream(s: str):
  return "Echo: " + s.capitalize()
```

</div>
